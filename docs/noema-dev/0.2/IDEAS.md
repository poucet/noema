Lightweight inbox for ideas not yet in the roadmap.

## Inbox

| # | Idea | Notes | Added |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Access control model for resources | Different people accessing different models, tools, contexts, conversations, documents, assets. Not just is_private but proper ACL/permissions. | 2026-01-10 |
| 4 | Local filesystem as first-class citizen | Easy markdown import/export for AI design conversations. Accelerates agentic behavior by enabling design work with AI models inside noema. | 2026-01-10 |
| 5 | Dynamic Typst functions for data queries | Typst functions that generate content from noema store data (bug counts, stats, charts). Computed on-the-fly in UI, templatized in storage. When injected into LLM context, evaluate and include both raw template code and generated output. | 2026-01-10 |
| 6 | Proactive AI check-ins | AI initiates conversations after inactivity with check-in prompts. Templatizable check-in patterns for different contexts (e.g. project status, mood, goals). | 2026-01-10 |
| 7 | Endless conversation as main entry point | Single continuous conversation that manages context history in the background. No explicit session boundaries. | 2026-01-10 |
| 8 | Auto-journaling from interactions | Log/journal entries automatically appended based on chats and document interactions. Passive capture of activity and insights. | 2026-01-10 |
