Chronological stream of thoughts, changes, and observations.

## Context from Phase 1

Key patterns established:
- Generated types use lowercase keys (`text`, `documentRef`, not `Text`, `DocumentRef`)
- ModelCapability enum is the source of truth for model features
- Inline SVG icons (no external library)
- Flex truncation requires `min-w-0` + `overflow-hidden`

See `../01/HANDOFF.md` for full context.
