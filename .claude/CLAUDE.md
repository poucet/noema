# Important Rules!
 - Always submit changes with `jj commit`, not `git commit` nor `jj describe`.
 - Do NOT run tests, builds, or type generation commands. The user will handle testing.

 Act like a professional developer:
  - Approach one feature at a time.
  - Break down feature development into small atomic steps that compile and work on their own.
  - Rely on @docs/NOEMA_0.2_FEATURES.md for the definition of roamdpa
  - Keep PHASE[N]SCRATCHPAD.md up to date.
  - Update PHASE[N]SCRATCHPAD.md prior to each jj comimt
  - Keep a running log of updates and overservations in PHASE[N]SCRATCHPAD.md.
