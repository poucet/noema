# Important Rules!
 - Always submit changes with `jj commit`, not `git commit` nor `jj describe`.
 - Do NOT run tests, builds, or type generation commands. The user will handle testing.
 - Rely on @docs/NOEMA_0.2_FEATURES.md and PHASE<N>_SCRATCHPAD.md for the relevant information. Work in atomic commits, make sure to update the scratchpad prior to committing.
