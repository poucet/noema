# Pre-Compact Hook Configuration

PHASE=1

---

IMPORTANT: Pre-compact reminder for Phase {{PHASE}}

Before compacting, ensure you have updated the current PHASE scratchpad with:

- Current progress and status of in-progress features
- Any key decisions or architectural notes made this session
- Updated todo status in the feature table
- Notes that would help resume work after context is cleared

The scratchpad file is: `docs/PHASE{{PHASE}}_SCRATCHPAD.md`

Reference the roadmap at: `docs/NOEMA_0.2_FEATURES.md`

If you have not updated the scratchpad, please do so now before proceeding with compaction.
